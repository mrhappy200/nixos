# My nix config
## You can /try/ to use it...
###### It probably won't work

# Credits
Basically all of this was copied from Gabriel Fontes (misterio77) huge thanks to him for making [his config](https://github.com/misterio77/nix-config) public

Also thanks to the guy from tmpfs as {root, home} and all redditors and discourse users who have provided the only good documentation for Nix on the internet ;)
